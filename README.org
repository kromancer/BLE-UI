* Camera Connected

After the camera selection window, the user is presented with the main application window.
This is how the main GUI window looks when camera contectivity has been successfully established.
In the bottom of the panel there is a toolbar ribbon that contains the following buttons (left to right):
   -  Show/hide stage control window
   -  Play/pause image stream
   -  Capture image. By pressing this button a directory selection dialog window pops, 
      where the user specifies where the image shall be saved. The format used is bmp.
   -  Maximize/minimize size. Maximized, the size is 1288 x 964. Minimized is half.
   -  Show/hide camera settings window.
