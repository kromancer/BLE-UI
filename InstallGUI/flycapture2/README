To install FlyCapture2 on linux you will need to have a few prerequisite
libraries installed.  Below is a list of libs that flycapture2 depends on.

DEPENDENCIES:

1) libraw1394-8
2) libgtkmm-2.4-dev
3) libglademm-2.4-dev
4) libgtkglextmm-x11-dev (libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev in Ubuntu 8.10 and up)
5) libusb-1.0 (Only in Ubuntu 9.04 and up)


Ubuntu 14.04:
user$:	sudo apt-get install libraw1394-11 libgtkmm-2.4-1c2a libglademm-2.4-1c2a libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2 libusb-1.0-0

Ubuntu 12.04:
user$:	sudo apt-get install libraw1394-11 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev libusb-1.0-0

Ubuntu 10.04:
user$:	sudo apt-get install libraw1394-11 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev libusb-1.0-0

Ubuntu 9.04:
user$:	sudo apt-get install libraw1394-8 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-dev libusb-1.0

Ubuntu 8.10:
user$:	sudo apt-get install libraw1394-8 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev

Ubuntu 8.04:
user$:	sudo apt-get install libraw1394-8 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-dev

libusb-1.0 for distributions earlier than 9.04 can be obtained from the
Point Grey downloads section. libusb-1.0 can be then be manually installed by 
double clicking the extracted .deb package and following the instructions.

After installing raw1394 you may need to add the raw1394 module to be loaded on start.  
To do this just add "raw1394" to the /etc/modules file.

FLYCAPTURE2 INSTALLATION:

Once all the Dependencies are installed just install the flycapture deb files.  There are 
ten different packages that need to be installed.

The flycapture packagesa are:
- libflycapture-<version>_<platorm>.deb
- libflycapture-<version>_<platorm>-dev.deb
- libflycapturegui-<version>_<platorm>.deb
- libflycapturegui-<version>_<platorm>-dev.deb
- libflycapture-c-<version>_<platorm>.deb
- libflycapture-c-<version>_<platorm>-dev.deb
- libflycapturegui-c-<version>_<platorm>.deb
- libflycapturegui-c-<version>_<platorm>-dev.deb
- flycap-<version>_<platorm>.deb
- flycapture-doc-<version>_<platform>.deb

The packages with a preceding 'lib' are all the shared objects and their
respective dev packages.  The flycap package installs the capture application which
can be launched by typing 'flycap' in a terminal or through the Applications menu.
The flycapture-doc package contains our documentation in pdf format.

To install these packages we provide an easy to use install script.  You can run the 
script in the same directory that you have unpacked the software into.  The install script 
is called 'install_flycapture.sh'

code eg:
user$ sudo sh install_flycapture.sh

This script will install all the flycapture libraries, example code, example apps and 
documentation.  The flycapture install script will also ask you to configure udev so that 
a user will be able to use the 1394 and usb devices.  If you choose to configure the 1394 and 
usb devices this script will change permissions on the nodes to give this particular user full
read and write access to the device nodes.  It will overwrite the default ubuntu permissions.  
After running this script everything should be installed and set up for use.

Unfortunately restarting udev doesn't seem to set the permissions on the device nodes immediatly.
You may need to restart the machine before the user can acces the device nodes.

FLYCAPTURE2 REMOVAL

To remove flycapture2 just run the uninstall script that we provide.  The removal script will also
remove the udev rules therefore restoring the original ubuntu permissions on the device nodes.

code eg:
user$: sudo sh remove_flycapture
